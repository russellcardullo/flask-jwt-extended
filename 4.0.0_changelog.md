Breaking Changes
----------------
* Drop support for python 2

* Depreciated warnings have been removed and are now errors:
    - Support for `JWT_CSRF_HEADER_NAME` config option is removed
    - `jwt.expired_token_loader` callback will error if it does not take an argument
      for the expired token
    - `jwt.decode_key_loader` callback will error if it does not take an argument
      for the unverified_claims and the unverified_headers

* All view decorators have been moved under a single method:
    - `@jwt_required` is now `@jwt_required()`
    - `@jwt_optional` is now `@jwt_required(optional=True)`
    - `@fresh_jwt_required` is now `@jwt_required(fresh=True)`
    - `@jwt_refresh_token_required` is now `@jwt_required(refresh=True)`
    - `verify_jwt_in_request_optional` is now `verify_jwt_in_request(optional=True)`
    - `verify_jwt_refresh_token_in_request` is now `verify_jwt_in_request(refresh=True)`
    - `verify_fresh_jwt_in_request` is now `verify_jwt_in_request(fresh=True)`

* The default `JWT_IDENTITY_CLAIM` is now `sub` instead of `identity`

* Renamed `get_raw_jwt()` to `get_jwt()`

* Renamed `get_raw_jwt_headers()` to `get_jwt_headers()`

* Removed `get_jwt_claims()`. Use `get_jwt()` instead, and see next item for
  how this is different

* Remove `JWT_USER_CLAIMS` config options. All of the custom claims will now go
  on the top level of the JWT instead of in a nested dictionary. This makes it
  easier to override/modify reserved claims (`iss`, `nbt`, etc) in your application
    - TODO: Note the implications of this when updating the applicatino if you
      have old and new tokens present.

* If you pass in the `user_claims` option to `create_access_token`, it will now
  be merged with the default claims and any claims provided by the
  `@jwt.user_claims_loader` callback function.

* Renamed `@jwt.user_loader_callback_loader` to `@jwt.user_lookup_loader`

* Renamed `@jwt.user_loader_error_loader` to `@jwt.user_lookup_error_loader`

* Raises a RuntimeError when calling `get_jwt()`, `get_jwt_header()`, or
  `get_jwt_identity()` when accessed outside of a protected context (aka,
  if you forgot to call `@jwt.required()` or `verify_jwt_in_request()`.
  Previously these calls would return `None`.

* Raises a RuntimeError when no `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` is provided and
  `get_current_user()` or `current_user` is called

* Raise an error if calling `get_jwt` (et al) when not in a decorated function.
  Need to make some considerations for how this should work with `jwt_optional`

* The following callback functions now no longer have access to `get_raw_jwt` and
  instead have the token data explicitly passed in as the arguments :
    - `needs_fresh_token_loaders`
    - claims_verification_failed_loader

  An example of this looks like:
  ```python
  @needs_fresh_token_loader
  def non_fresh_token_response(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
      return jsonify(msg="Yo {} you need a fresh token".format(jwt_data['sub']), 401)
  ```

* The callback function for `user_lookup_loader` no longer takes `identity`
  as an argument. Instead it takes `jwt_header` and `jwt_data`:

  ```python
  @user_lookup_loader
  def handle_user_lookup(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
      identity = jwt_data['sub']
      return UserObject(username=identity)
  ```

* The callback function for `user_lookup_error_loader` no longer takes `identity`
  as an argument. Instead it takes `jwt_header` and `jwt_data`:

  ```python
  @user_lookup_error_loader
  def handle_user_lookup_error(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
      identity = jwt_data['sub']
      return jsonify(msg="{} not found".format(identity)), 401
  ```

* The callback function for `handle_expired_error` no longer just takes `expired_jwt_data`
  as an argument. Instead it takes `expired_jwt_header` and `expired_jwt_data`:

  ```python
  @user_lookup_error_loader
  def handle_expired_error(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
      identity = jwt_data['sub']
      return jsonify(msg="{} has an expired jwt".format(identity)), 401
  ```

New Things
----------
* Use Black, Flake8, and Reorder Python Imports in conjunction with Pre-Commit
  to inforce style on code changes.

* Clean up a bunch of code behind the scenes

TODO
----
* Look at all the public facing API, and make sure every change there is documented.
  This includes re-ordering of the arguments to a function, different function
  name, etc, etc.

* A good way to have multiple tokens in the same request? Think on that more.

* Don't rely on `get_raw_jwt` (et al) in error callback functions. Instead, pass
  the entire contents of the token to the callback functions as needed. Less global
  state.

* Add support for pypy3

* Finish dropping support for python2

* Remove pep8speaks plugin from repo

* Update documentation for all the things
